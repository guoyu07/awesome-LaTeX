A curated list of LaTeX, inspired by [awesome-computer-vision](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision)

## Introduction
LaTeX is a document preparation system for high-quality typesetting. It is most often used for medium-to-large technical or scientific documents but it can be used for almost any form of publishing. LaTeX is not a word processor! Instead, LaTeX encourages authors not to worry too much about the appearance of their documents but to concentrate on getting the right content. More details about LaTeX can be found on [latex-project](https://latex-project.org/intro.html).

This is a list of resources about LaTeX. I build this directory according to an excellent websites [LaTeXStudio](http://www.latexstudio.net/). I really appreciate it.
